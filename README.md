# OpenGL representation of Sierpinkski's Triangle

## Background

Sierpinski's Triangle is a fractal pattern formed by repeatedly dividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles and removing the central triangle. This process is then applied recursively to the remaining smaller triangles. The result is a self-replicating pattern that exhibits intricate detail and complexity.

## Program

This model is created using OpenGL 3.3. This rendition uses a recursive algirthim to change the vertex shader to translate and scale each triangle accordingly.
